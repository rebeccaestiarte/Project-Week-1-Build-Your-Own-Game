## Project Description
For this first project, I decided to adapt the classic game "The Hangman" to the universe of Star Wars. While the rule of the games are similar to the original version of "The Hangman", the user experience is customize to make the game more enjoyable for Star Wars fans.

## Rules
The user will be given an encrypted phrase: a series of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the phrase. He will be asked to guess one letter at a time to solve the word puzzle, by inserting it on its keyboard. If the user suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the program will fills in the blanks with that letter in the right place/s. If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the program will count the attempt as failed. If the user doesn't guess the phrase before its allowed attempts are over, it will lose the game. Otherwise, he will win.

## Workflow
My workflow started with planning, followed by psico-coding. From then on the worflow became circular: with a cycle of coding and debugging. Many times the planning had to be updated due to time management issues.

## Organization
I organized my work using a trello board. I wrote down all deliverables for the project and then broke-down all the activities I needed to accomplish to finalize the code, which was the main deliverable. I followed the plan and undated the trello board everytime an activities was completed.
